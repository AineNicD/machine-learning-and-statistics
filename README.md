This repository contains two jupyter notebooks written in [python](https://www.python.org/) programming language for assessment in the module Machine learning and statistics in GMIT HDip Data Analytics. 
## 1. [scikit-learn.ipynb](https://github.com/AineNicD/machine-learning-and-statistics/blob/main/scikit-learn.ipynb) 
~~~
Scikit-Learn Jupyter Notebook contains the following.
- A clear and concise overview of the scikit-learn Python library.
- Demonstrations of three interesting scikit-learn algorithms. 
- Appropriate plots and other visualisations to enhance the notebook for viewers.

<p>
 scikit-learn notebook begins with an overview of the scikit-learn python library. I go into greater detail about types of machine learning and the classes available within the package that assist this. For the library overview, I explain supervised learning, classification, regression, unsupervised learning, clustering, dimensionality reduction, Model selection, preprocessing and sklearn data sets available within the scikit-learn python package. I examine three scikit-learn algorithms in more detail - Support vector machines, k-means and Guassian Naive Bayes. I have plots and images throughout the notebook to enhance it for viewers. Followed by concluding thoughts about the scikit-learn python library.

## 2. [scipy-stats.ipynb](https://github.com/AineNicD/machine-learning-and-statistics/blob/main/scipy-stats.ipynb)
~~~
Scipy Stats Jupyter Notebook contains the following.
- A clear and concise overview of the scipy.stats Python library.
- An example hypothesis test using ANOVA. I found a data set on which
it is appropriate to use ANOVA, ensured the assumptions underlying ANOVA are
met, and then performed and displayed the results of ANOVA using scipy.stats.
- Appropriate plots and other visualisations to enhance the notebook for viewers.

<p>
Scipy.stats notebook begins with an overview of the scipy.stats python library; with detailed descriptions of probability distributions and scipy.stats implementations. I have examples of descriptive statisitcs available within the package. Next I explain Avova to the best of my understanding, perform one-way-anova on a sample dataset `difficile.csv`, a ficticious dataset created for examples by open source data. Following this I perform two-way-anova on a dataset, `Tooth Growth`. A dataset about the effects of vitamin C supplements on tooth length. I follow and explain the assumptions of Avova using scipy.stats with extra help from a seperate statistical function python package statsmodels to highlight the results of the hypothesis. I have plots and images throughout the notebook to enhance it for viewers. Followed by concluding thoughts about the scipy.stats python library.

 # Binder
You can view the notebooks in dynamic form using [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) by clicking on the following image:
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/AineNicD/machine-learning-and-statistics/HEAD)

<details><summary>click here for more about Binder</summary>
<p>
 Binder is an open-source service for making GitHub repositorys interactive. With the click of a button, users get a virtual compute environment where they can run your code and reproduce your results. It's also a great way to test whether you've defined all the dependencies for your project.

# requirements.txt

There is also a [requirements.txt](https://github.com/AineNicD/machine-learning-and-statistics/blob/main/requirements.txt) file that enables someone to quickly run the notebooks with minimal configuration. requirements.txt files are used for specifying what python packages are required to run the project you are looking at.


# Install
- [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) -is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. It is best installed with [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/). Jupyter can also be installed separately from its [website](https://jupyter.org/).
- [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) simplifies package management and deployment by having the most popular python packages installed on your machine even before you know you will be using them. 

<br>

## Launching Jupyter Notebook App
The Jupyter Notebook App can be launched by clicking on the Jupyter Notebook icon installed by Anaconda in the start menu or by typing 'Jupyter Notebook' in a terminal.

## How do run/save a jupyter notebook
- First click on Raw.
- Then, press ctrl+s to save it as a .ipynb file (files from GitHub are saved as text files as default, so you'll have to manually type '. ipynb' after the file name to make this work.)
- Open up a terminal and type in Jupyter Notebook
- Jupyter notebook should appear in your default browser 
- Go to the file location where you saved the .ipynb
- Open file.

# Credits 

* Ian McLoughlin course material, lecture videos and detailed jupyter notebooks helped me to understand scikit-learn machine learning algorithms and scipy.stats Anova implementation which had a great influence on putting together these notebooks for my project. 
* scikit-learn documentation, available at: [Scikit-learn.org](	https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) was essential for the scikit-learn notebook. It provides detailed explanations of what the python library has to offer which helped me understand and come up with my own overview of the scikit-learn python library for my notebook. 
* Statistical functions (scipy.stats) documentation, available at: [Docs.scipy.org](	https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/stats.html), has detailed explanations of the statistical functions available within the scipy.stats python library which helped me understand and create my own overview for my notebook. 
* [Tutorials point](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/index.htm) has a detailed overview of both [scikit-learn](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/scikit_learn/index.htm) and [scipy-stats](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/scipy/scipy_stats.htm) , it was a good point of reference on all the libraries have to offer and helped me gain a high-level understanding of them. 
* Jacob T VanderPlas, has written many books on python data science and has made these books available free to everyone on github, these guides are fantastic and I found	"Python data science handbook" O'Reilly particularly helpful in my learning. It is available at [Vanderplas's github repository](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/). He is currently a software engineer at Google Research in Seattle, and developer on a number of open source Python projects.
* [Medium](https://medium.com/) is an open platform where readers find dynamic thinking, and where expert and undiscovered voices can share their writing on any topic. Some blog posts are free but I subscribed for 5euro a month to access more detailed articles explaining topics such as Lorraine Li's "K-Means Clustering with scikit-learn" post on [towardsdatascience.com](https://towardsdatascience.com/k-means-clustering-with-scikit-learn-6b47a369a83c). Towards data science is A Medium publication that provides a platform for thousands of people to exchange ideas and code to expand our understanding of data science.
