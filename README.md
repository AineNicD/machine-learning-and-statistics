GMIT Machine Learning and Statistics Assessment 2021. 

This repository contains two jupyter notebooks for assessment in the module Machine learning and statistics in GMIT HDip Data Analytics. 
### 1. [scikit-learn.ipynb](https://github.com/AineNicD/machine-learning-and-statistics/blob/main/scikit-learn.ipynb) 2. [scipy-stats.ipynb](https://github.com/AineNicD/machine-learning-and-statistics/blob/main/scipy-stats.ipynb)

The notebooks can also be viewed in static form by clicking on the following images:
1. scikit-learn.ipynb: [![nbviewer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jupyter/design/master/logos/Badges/nbviewer_badge.svg)](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/AineNicD/machine-learning-and-statistics/blob/main/scikit-learn.ipynb)
2. scipy-stats.ipynb: [![nbviewer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jupyter/design/master/logos/Badges/nbviewer_badge.svg)](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/AineNicD/machine-learning-and-statistics/blob/main/scipy-stats.ipynb)

You can view the notebooks in dynamic form by clicking on the following images:

There is also  a [requirements.txt](https://github.com/AineNicD/machine-learning-and-statistics/blob/main/requirements.txt) file that enables someone to quickly run the notebooks with minimal configuration. 


#### [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)
-is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. It is best installed with [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/). 
Anaconda simplifies package management and deployment by having the most popular python packages installed on your machine even before you know you will be using them. 
Jupyter can also be installed separately from its [website](https://jupyter.org/).

### Launching Jupyter Notebook App
The Jupyter Notebook App can be launched by clicking on the Jupyter Notebook icon installed by Anaconda in the start menu or by typing 'Jupyter Notebook' in a terminal.
### How do run/save a jupyter notebook
- First click on Raw.
- Then, press ctrl+s to save it as a .ipynb file (files from GitHub are saved as text files as default, so you'll have to manually type '. ipynb' after the file name to make this work.)
- Open up a terminal and type in Jupyter Notebook
- Jupyter notebook should appear in your default browser 
- Go to the file location where you saved the .ipynb
- Open file.
