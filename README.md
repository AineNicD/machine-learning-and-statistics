This repository contains two jupyter notebooks written in [python](https://www.python.org/) programming language for assessment in the module Machine learning and statistics in GMIT HDip Data Analytics. 
### 1. [scikit-learn.ipynb](https://github.com/AineNicD/machine-learning-and-statistics/blob/main/scikit-learn.ipynb) 
~~~
Scikit-Learn Jupyter Notebook contains the following.
- A clear and concise overview of the scikit-learn Python library.
- Demonstrations of three interesting scikit-learn algorithms. 
- Appropriate plots and other visualisations to enhance the notebook for viewers.

### 2. [scipy-stats.ipynb](https://github.com/AineNicD/machine-learning-and-statistics/blob/main/scipy-stats.ipynb)
~~~
Scipy Stats Jupyter Notebook contains the following.
- A clear and concise overview of the scipy.stats Python library.
- An example hypothesis test using ANOVA. I found a data set on which
it is appropriate to use ANOVA, ensured the assumptions underlying ANOVA are
met, and then performed and displayed the results of ANOVA using scipy.stats.
- Appropriate plots and other visualisations to enhance the notebook for viewers.

The notebooks can be viewed in static form on [Nbviewer](https://nbviewer.org/) by clicking on the following images:
1. scikit-learn.ipynb: [![nbviewer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jupyter/design/master/logos/Badges/nbviewer_badge.svg)](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/AineNicD/machine-learning-and-statistics/blob/main/scikit-learn.ipynb)
2. scipy-stats.ipynb: [![nbviewer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jupyter/design/master/logos/Badges/nbviewer_badge.svg)](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/AineNicD/machine-learning-and-statistics/blob/main/scipy-stats.ipynb)
<br>
Nbviewer is a web application that lets you enter the URL of a Jupyter Notebook file, renders that notebook as a static HTML web page, and gives you a stable link to that page which you can share with others. There is also an option to download the notebook in the top right corner.

You can view the notebooks in dynamic form using [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) by clicking on the following image:
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/AineNicD/machine-learning-and-statistics/HEAD)


Binder is a tool that lets other people easily launch an interactive copy of your Jupyter notebooks.
<br>

There is also a [requirements.txt](https://github.com/AineNicD/machine-learning-and-statistics/blob/main/requirements.txt) file that enables someone to quickly run the notebooks with minimal configuration. 


### Install
- [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) -is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. It is best installed with [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/). Jupyter can also be installed separately from its [website](https://jupyter.org/).
- [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) simplifies package management and deployment by having the most popular python packages installed on your machine even before you know you will be using them. 


### Launching Jupyter Notebook App
The Jupyter Notebook App can be launched by clicking on the Jupyter Notebook icon installed by Anaconda in the start menu or by typing 'Jupyter Notebook' in a terminal.
### How do run/save a jupyter notebook
- First click on Raw.
- Then, press ctrl+s to save it as a .ipynb file (files from GitHub are saved as text files as default, so you'll have to manually type '. ipynb' after the file name to make this work.)
- Open up a terminal and type in Jupyter Notebook
- Jupyter notebook should appear in your default browser 
- Go to the file location where you saved the .ipynb
- Open file.

### You can also download this repository:

Click on the green code button at the top right, go to "Clone or download" drop down menu and copy below url:
https://github.com/AineNicD/machine-learning-and-statistics.git

 ![](https://github.com/AineNicD/machine-learning-and-statistics/blob/main/images/howtodownload.png)
 
 Open up a terminal and run the command below to clone the repository locally on your machine:
 - git clone https://github.com/AineNicD/machine-learning-and-statistics.git

It can also be downloaded as a zip folder. 
 

### How to execute the notebook
 - Launch the Jupyter Notebook App.
 - In the Notebook Dashboard navigate to find the notebook: clicking on its name will open it in a new browser tab.
 - Click on the menu Help -> User Interface Tour for an overview of the Jupyter Notebook App user interface.
 - You can run the notebook document step-by-step (one cell a time) by pressing shift + enter.
 - You can run the whole notebook in a single step by clicking on the menu Cell -> Run All.
 - To restart the kernel, click on the menu Kernel -> Restart.

Note: Modifications to the notebooks are automatically saved every few minutes. To avoid modifying the original notebook, make a copy of the notebook document (menu File -> Make a copy â€¦) and save the modifications on the copy.
