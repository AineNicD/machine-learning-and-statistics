GMIT Machine Learning and Statistics Assessment 2021. 

This repository contains two jupyter notebooks for assessment in the module Machine learning and statistics in GMIT HDip Data Analytics. 
### 1. [scikit-learn.ipynb](https://github.com/AineNicD/machine-learning-and-statistics/blob/main/scikit-learn.ipynb) 
~~~
Scikit-Learn Jupyter Notebook contains the following.
- A clear and concise overview of the scikit-learn Python library.
- Demonstrations of three interesting scikit-learn algorithms. 
- Appropriate plots and other visualisations to enhance the notebook for viewers.

### 2. [scipy-stats.ipynb](https://github.com/AineNicD/machine-learning-and-statistics/blob/main/scipy-stats.ipynb)
~~~
Scipy Stats Jupyter Notebook contains the following.
- A clear and concise overview of the scipy.stats Python library.
- An example hypothesis test using ANOVA. I found a data set on which
it is appropriate to use ANOVA, ensured the assumptions underlying ANOVA are
met, and then performed and displayed the results of ANOVA using scipy.stats.
- Appropriate plots and other visualisations to enhance the notebook for viewers.

There is also  a [requirements.txt](https://github.com/AineNicD/machine-learning-and-statistics/blob/main/requirements.txt) file that enables someone to quickly run the notebooks with minimal configuration. 


#### [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)
-is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. It is best installed with [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/). 
Anaconda simplifies package management and deployment by having the most popular python packages installed on your machine even before you know you will be using them. 
Jupyter can also be installed separately from its [website](https://jupyter.org/).

### Launching Jupyter Notebook App
The Jupyter Notebook App can be launched by clicking on the Jupyter Notebook icon installed by Anaconda in the start menu or by typing 'Jupyter Notebook' in a terminal.
### How do run/save a jupyter notebook
- First click on Raw.
- Then, press ctrl+s to save it as a .ipynb file (files from GitHub are saved as text files as default, so you'll have to manually type '. ipynb' after the file name to make this work.)
- Open up a terminal and type in Jupyter Notebook
- Jupyter notebook should appear in your default browser 
- Go to the file location where you saved the .ipynb
- Open file.
